# 🐄 Global Meat Production Dashboard – A Power BI + Python Rebuild of OWID Visuals

## 📌 Overview

This project replicates the **"Animals Slaughtered for Meat"** interactive dashboard from [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat) using **Power BI and Python**.

Rather than attempting to improve OWID's excellent existing tool, the aim here is to:
- Recreate its core visual functionality within Power BI
- Practice full-stack data handling: from sourcing and cleaning to dashboard building
- Build an offline, customizable version of the original for exploration, resume-building, and skill demonstration

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python + Pandas** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Data preprocessing and validation
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data visualization and interactivity
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project documentation

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📊 Rebuild a filterable dashboard showing **yearly animal slaughter counts** by country/region and meat type
- 🧼 Handle raw OWID data, especially **mixed entities** (countries, continents, regions) for accurate filtering and comparison
- 🔍 Enable graph switching (table, line, bar) and interactive filtering by year, country, or animal type
- 🧪 Showcase skills in:
  - **Data wrangling**
  - **Business Intelligence**
  - **Dashboard development**

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- 🧩 **Filters** for:
  - Country or Region Type (e.g., Country, Continent, FAO, etc.)
  - Entity (e.g., Italy, Africa, World)
  - Year Range
  - Meat Type (Chicken, Pig, Duck, etc.)
- 📈 **Graph Toggle Buttons** (Line, Bar, Table)
- 🌍 **Region-aware ranking metrics** (Absolute & Relative Change with dynamic ranks)
- 🏳️ **Country Flags** and stylized page layout for better storytelling
- 🔄 Designed to **mimic the functionality** of OWID’s online tool in an offline Power BI environment
