# 🐄 Global Meat Production Dashboard – A Power BI and Python Data Project

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes global data on the number of animals slaughtered for meat each year, originally published by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?tab=table&time=1962..2023).

The original online visualization, while valuable, presents a **somewhat clunky interface** for deeper analysis:
- The **timeline slider** is unintuitive for quickly selecting a specific year or range.
- The **data table combines regional and country-level metrics**, which can lead to misleading comparisons or duplicated aggregates.

To improve usability and unlock deeper insights, I built a **refined and interactive Power BI dashboard** using a cleaned version of the source data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 Create a **clear and filterable dashboard** to visualize trends in meat production by country and animal type
- 🧼 **Separate countries from regional aggregates** to ensure data granularity and accuracy
- 📈 Allow users to easily explore trends over time without dealing with cumbersome UI elements
- 🧪 Showcase skills in **data wrangling, visualization, and dashboard building** to demonstrate readiness for roles in:
  - **Data Analysis**
  - **Data Engineering**
  - **Business Intelligence (BI)**
